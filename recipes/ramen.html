    <h1>Ramen Recipe</h1>
    <img src="../images/Ramen.jpeg"></a>
    <p>Making ramen from scratch is pretty darn elaborate. 
        It can be a multiday affair, and if you simply don’t have time for it, it can seem very intimidating. 
        (No, we’re not making our own noodles this time around...I’m taking it easy on you for now.) 
         </p>

         <h3>Ingredients</h3>
         <ul>
             <li>1 Tablespoon sesame oil</li>
             <li> 3 teaspoons grated ginger</li>
             <li>4 teaspoons grated garlic</li>
             <li>4 cups chicken broth</li>
             <li>4 cups water</li>
             <li>1 ounce dried shiitake mushrooms</li>
             <li>2 packges instant ramen</li>
             <li>1/2 cup chopped scallions or chives</li>
             <li>1 cups shredded carrots</li>
             <li>sriracha to taste</li>

             <h3>Steps</h3>
             <ol>
                 <li>Heat the sesame oil in a large skillet over medium low heat. Add the garlic and ginger; stir fry for 2 minutes or until soft and fragrant.</li>
                 <li>Add the broth and the water. Bring to a simmer; add the mushrooms and simmer for 10 minutes or until the mushrooms have softened and the broth is flavorful.</li>
                 <li>Add the instant noodles to the hot liquid and simmer for an additional 5 minutes or until the noodles have softened. Add the scallions and stir to combine.</li>
                 <li>Remove from heat, stir in the kale and carrots, and top with crunchy panko crumbs (see notes) and a soft-boiled egg (optional). Season with chili oil, hot sauce, sesame oil, and/or soy sauce and salt to taste.</li>
             </ol>
         </ul>
